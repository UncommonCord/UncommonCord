## Howdy, partners ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on going further in the data analytics world while also leveraging all the tools that are at my grasp.
Learning Python, Snowflake and additional Power BI elements are my top priorities right now.
Willing to collaborate and help with any outstanding projects for which my skills could add some sort of value. Skills to consider would be ETL processes and data visualization.

**Fun facts**

Love video games, pizza, my wife & daughter; not exactly in that order.
Contemplating going solo camping for the first time, so any tips and recommendations are more than welcome; taking into consideration I'm from Puerto Rico and the weather is always variable.

**Contact Information**

Not a fan of giving out my contact information, so any outreach can be directed through the repository itself.
